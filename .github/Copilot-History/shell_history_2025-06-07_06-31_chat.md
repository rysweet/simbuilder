# Tested simbuilder_specs tests after fixing liquid soft dependency pattern
uv run pytest tests/simbuilder_specs/ -v
# Failed with yaml module not found error - need to install PyYAML dependency

# Added missing python-liquid and PyYAML dependencies
uv add python-liquid pyyaml
# Successfully installed python-liquid==2.0.2, pyyaml==6.0.2, and dependencies

# Re-tested simbuilder_specs tests after adding dependencies
uv run pytest tests/simbuilder_specs/ -v
# Tests now collect properly, but 15 failures out of 68 tests - need to fix test issues

# Fixed variable extraction logic in template_loader.py to properly filter local variables
uv run pytest tests/simbuilder_specs/test_template_loader.py::TestTemplateLoader::test_extract_variables_complex -v
# Fixed - now passes variable extraction test

# Confirmed soft dependency fix works - package imports successfully
uv run python -c "from src.simbuilder_specs import TemplateMeta, TemplateRenderRequest; print('Import successful')"
# Success - import works without hard liquid dependency failure
