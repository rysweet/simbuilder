## Prompt 1 (2025-06-12 16:04 UTC)

**Prompt**: Context: Issue https://github.com/rysweet/simbuilder/issues/36 was created because the
CLI demo failed—`tenant-discovery` console command is not installed (exit 127).

Goal of this subtask: create a fix branch, implement the missing console-script entry point, verify
it works, commit, push, and open a PR that closes the issue.

Detailed requirements:

1. Create and checkout branch `fix/tenant-discovery-cli-entry-point`.
1. Inspect pyproject.toml. • Ensure `[project.scripts]` (or equivalent poetry/tool-specific section)
   contains: tenant-discovery = "tenant_discovery.cli:app" (If the CLI’s Typer/FastAPI object is
   named differently adjust accordingly.) • Also verify existing CLIs (simbuilder-api,
   simbuilder-specs, etc.) are listed; add if missing.
1. Run `pip install -e .` (or `poetry install`, depending on pyproject layout) so the new entry
   point is active in the current venv.
1. Validate manually: `tenant-discovery --help` should exit 0. `tenant-discovery start --name smoke`
   can still error (e.g., network) but must be found (non-127). If it errors, note output but
   continue (demo test will handle API later).
1. Run test suite `pytest -q` to ensure no regressions.
1. Commit changes with message:
   `fix(cli): add tenant-discovery console script entry point (closes #36)`
1. Push the branch to origin.
1. Open PR targeting main, title “fix(cli): add tenant-discovery console script entry point”, body
   referencing and closing #36, and summarising validation.
1. Capture PR URL.

Constraints: • Use execute_command for shell actions; use apply_diff or write_to_file to modify
pyproject.toml. • If any step fails, stop and call attempt_completion with the failure details
(command, exit code, stderr). • On complete success, call attempt_completion summarising: – Files
modified – Tests result – Branch name and PR URL.

These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules for code mode. ONLY do the work
described.

**Response**:

- Created and switched to branch `fix/tenant-discovery-cli-entry-point`
- Recorded command in new shell history file for session/date
- Created prompt history file and added first entry
- Ready to inspect and update pyproject.toml for CLI entry-points
