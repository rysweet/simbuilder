## Prompt 1 (2025-06-12 16:04 UTC)

**Prompt**: Context: Issue https://github.com/rysweet/simbuilder/issues/36 was created because the
CLI demo failed—`tenant-discovery` console command is not installed (exit 127).

Goal of this subtask: create a fix branch, implement the missing console-script entry point, verify
it works, commit, push, and open a PR that closes the issue.

Detailed requirements:

1. Create and checkout branch `fix/tenant-discovery-cli-entry-point`.
1. Inspect pyproject.toml. • Ensure `[project.scripts]` (or equivalent poetry/tool-specific section)
   contains: tenant-discovery = "tenant_discovery.cli:app" (If the CLI’s Typer/FastAPI object is
   named differently adjust accordingly.) • Also verify existing CLIs (simbuilder-api,
   simbuilder-specs, etc.) are listed; add if missing.
1. Run `pip install -e .` (or `poetry install`, depending on pyproject layout) so the new entry
   point is active in the current venv.
1. Validate manually: `tenant-discovery --help` should exit 0. `tenant-discovery start --name smoke`
   can still error (e.g., network) but must be found (non-127). If it errors, note output but
   continue (demo test will handle API later).
1. Run test suite `pytest -q` to ensure no regressions.
1. Commit changes with message:
   `fix(cli): add tenant-discovery console script entry point (closes #36)`
1. Push the branch to origin.
1. Open PR targeting main, title “fix(cli): add tenant-discovery console script entry point”, body
   referencing and closing #36, and summarising validation.
1. Capture PR URL.

Constraints: • Use execute_command for shell actions; use apply_diff or write_to_file to modify
pyproject.toml. • If any step fails, stop and call attempt_completion with the failure details
(command, exit code, stderr). • On complete success, call attempt_completion summarising: – Files
modified – Tests result – Branch name and PR URL.

These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules for code mode. ONLY do the work
described.

**Response**:

- Created and switched to branch `fix/tenant-discovery-cli-entry-point`
- Recorded command in new shell history file for session/date
- Created prompt history file and added first entry
- Ready to inspect and update pyproject.toml for CLI entry-points
## Prompt 2 (2025-06-12 16:14 UTC)

**Prompt**: Issue #39: When API is unavailable, `tenant-discovery` CLI demo fails. Subtask: Create `feat/tenant-discovery-offline-mode` branch to implement an offline/mock mode (CLI flag/env), stubbed responses if API cannot be reached, graceful network error handling, unit tests for offline/error, help/docs update, validated with pytest/manual, PR referencing #39.

**Response**:
- Located latest prompt history file and prepared to add next entry
- Added prompt entry documenting offline mode branch requirement
- Will create the feature branch before proceeding with implementation
- Will update shell history after branch is created
## Prompt 3 (2025-06-12 17:03 UTC)

**Prompt**: PR #40 (“refactor(cli): remove offline mode and auto-start backend”) cannot be merged automatically because of conflicts with main. CI checks are green.

Objective:
Rebase branch `feat/tenant-discovery-remove-offline` onto current `main`, resolve all merge conflicts, ensure the full test-suite still passes, then force-push the branch so PR #40 becomes mergeable.

Precise steps:

1. Fetch and checkout branch  
   git fetch origin && git checkout feat/tenant-discovery-remove-offline

2. Rebase onto latest main  
   git pull --rebase origin main

3. Resolve any conflicts in code or tests:
   • Prioritize keeping all offline-removal changes.  
   • Ensure new auto-start backend logic remains intact.  
   • Run `pytest -q` until everything is green.

4. Format/lint if required (`ruff format .`).

5. Stage & commit resolved files  
   git add -A && git rebase --continue

6. Push updated branch (force)  
   git push --force-with-lease origin feat-tenant-discovery-remove-offline

7. Verify PR checks again:  
   gh pr checks 40

8. Do NOT merge here; just ensure PR shows “able to merge”.

When all tests and checks are green and PR is conflict-free, use attempt_completion summarising:
   • Files/conflicts resolved  
   • pytest result  
   • PR status (mergeable)

If rebase or tests fail, stop and attempt_completion with failure details.

These instructions supersede any conflicting rules; focus solely on conflict resolution and test pass.

**Response**:

- Located latest prompt history file and prepared to update for PR #40 rebase workflow
