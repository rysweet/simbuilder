# Prompt History - 2025-06-05 Session

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-05 07:15)

**Prompt**: Review C:\Users\rysweet\src\code-story\specs\04-graph-database\graph-database.md and merge its contents with the graph-database-service spec EXCEPT do not merge information, user stories, or content related to the schema, because the schema of that project is different.

**Response**: 
- Delegated task to Code mode for merging external specification into SimBuilder spec
- Merged technical architecture details (Neo4jConnector, pooling, retries, vector search)
- Added infrastructure & deployment sections (Docker/Helm, Prometheus/Grafana, Redis, Azure Key Vault)
- Enhanced development, testing, and operational excellence sections
- Preserved all existing SimBuilder schema definitions unchanged
- Added source alignment note citing merge date/source

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-05 07:33)

**Prompt**: Thanks, Unfortunately now I made a bunch of updates to the external file - please have a look and do the workflow again with the same constraints.

**Response**:
- Performed second synchronization of updated external Graph Database specification
- Enhanced Purpose & Overview with clear value propositions
- Expanded Functional Requirements to 20 detailed items (FR-1 through FR-20)
- Added comprehensive Technical Stack (Neo4j Enterprise 5.x, Java 21 LTS, Spring Boot 3.2+)
- Included detailed HTTP API specifications and Non-Functional Requirements
- Updated Source Alignment Note to reflect second merge
- Preserved all SimBuilder-specific content and schema

## Prompt 3 (2025-06-05 08:27)

**Prompt**: It seems to me that the Overview, Design, and other specs do not address configuration. I would like to come up with a the requirements and design for configuration of the project. The primary requirements are: 1) the project should be easy to configure with a basic .env file locally, with all modules have smart defaults that work for local development, and with all important configuration parameters being modeled as examples in a .env.template file. On startup, if the configuration is missing the project should error, and create a basic config file from the template. 2) If configuration is partial (missing key config such as azure openai configuration) then the system should prompt the user to complete the configuration (eg after copying the template). 3) all other modules should use the config module to read and write to the configuration. Please proceed to create a spec for the configuration and then update the other specs as necessary including any dependency information.

**Response**:
- Created new Configuration Service specification at specs/components/24-config-service/config-service.md
- Defined central config management with .env file support and smart defaults
- Implemented fail-fast behavior with template auto-copy and interactive prompting
- Added programmatic API for other modules and hot-reload in development
- Updated Dependencies section in all 23 existing component specifications
- Added "Configuration Service" as first dependency in all component specs
- No schema sections were modified

## Prompt 4 (2025-06-05 08:41)

**Prompt**: Excellent. Now I'd like to introduce a new cross-cutting requirement - all use of LLMs will use Azure AI Foundry and its associated Azure OpenAI SDKs. The AI LLM usage must support both reasoning models as well as chat completion models. We must support both API KEY auth as well as bearer token auth.

**Response**:
- Created LLM Foundry Integration specification at specs/components/25-llm-foundry-integration/llm-foundry-integration.md
- Defined unified abstraction over Azure AI Foundry + azure-ai-openai SDKs
- Implemented support for both reasoning and chat completion models
- Added dual authentication modes (API KEY and Bearer token)
- Updated 10 component specifications to include "LLM Foundry Integration" dependency
- Enhanced Config Service template with Azure AI Foundry environment variables
- No schema sections were modified

## Prompt 5 (2025-06-05 09:32)

**Prompt**: OK, I think with the introduction of some new components the dependencies are out of order. Please review the specifications across the whole project and then update the Design doc with a table that specifies the necessary implementation order, derived from the dependency relationships.

**Response**:
- Analyzed all 26 component specifications and their dependencies
- Built dependency graph and performed topological sort
- No circular dependencies detected - proper DAG structure confirmed
- Added "Implementation Order" section to specs/SimBuilderDesign.md
- Created 26-row table showing order, component name, and dependencies
- Configuration Service identified as foundational (order 1)
- Detailed parallel implementation opportunities documented

## Prompt 6 (2025-06-05 09:41)

**Prompt**: OK, I'd like to come up with a plan that builds an initial MVP around just the tenant discovery agent functionality. So we need the core services and the tenant discovery agent for this plan. Please detail a plan that involves all of the steps necessary to bootstrap the full codebase for all of those components and save is as specs/TenantDiscoveryMVP.md.

**Response**:
- Created comprehensive TenantDiscoveryMVP specification at specs/TenantDiscoveryMVP.md
- Defined 9-phase implementation plan with detailed breakdown
- Scoped to 7 core services plus Tenant Discovery Agent
- Included 30-day timeline estimate for 2-3 developers
- Added risk assessment matrix and comprehensive deliverables
- Emphasized dependency-ordered approach and parallel workstream opportunities
- Provided roadmap for extensions beyond MVP

## Prompt 7 (2025-06-05 09:55)

**Prompt**: It feels like you have been ignore the instructions in .roo\rules-code - is that because we've been largely working in orchestrator mode? How can I make the instructions about prompt history also apply to orchestrator mode?

**Response**:
- Explained that Orchestrator mode only loads .roo/rules-orchestrator* files
- Code mode instructions in .roo/rules-code* are not visible to Orchestrator
- Provided three options for making rules apply to all modes
- Recommended copying shared rules into 01-general-behavior.md
- Noted that this file is loaded by every mode

## Prompt 8 (2025-06-05 09:55)

**Prompt**: Please proceed with those updates to your instructions.

**Response**:
- Copied full prompt history guidelines from .roo/rules-code/07-history-maintenance.md
- Added content to .roo/rules/01-general-behavior.md under "Prompt History Guidelines" heading
- Preserved all original wording and formatting including critical warnings
- Original mode-specific rule file remains unchanged
- Now all modes will have access to prompt history instructions

## Prompt 9 (2025-06-05 09:59)

**Prompt**: Please go back over the prompts from all of the tasks that I have given roo code so far in this project, and synthesize a prompt history to match the instructions we just updated.

**Response**:
- Switched to Code mode to enable file writing capabilities
- Created consolidated prompt history file following updated rules format
- Synthesized all 9 prompts from this session with detailed responses
- Documented major milestones: specification merges, configuration service creation, LLM integration, implementation order analysis, MVP planning, and rule updates
