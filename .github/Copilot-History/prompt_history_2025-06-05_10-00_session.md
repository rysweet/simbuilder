## Prompt 1 (2025-06-05)
**Prompt**: Context: The overall objective is to implement the TenantDiscoveryMVP. For every component referenced by specs/TenantDiscoveryMVP.md, ensure its spec contains a dedicated "Interfaces / API Signatures" section with precise interface details. Update Dependencies sections for bi-directional consistency. Cross-check for missing or circular dependencies and consistent interface names/schemas.

**Response**: 
- Read and analyzed TenantDiscoveryMVP.md to understand core components involved
- Examined Graph Database Service spec to understand current state of dependencies and interfaces
- Identified 7 core components for MVP: Configuration Service, Graph Database Service, Service Bus, Spec Library, Core API Service, LLM Foundry Integration, and Tenant Discovery Agent
- Found Graph Database Service already has detailed API specifications but needs interface consistency improvements
- Preparing to examine remaining component specs to create comprehensive interface documentation plan
