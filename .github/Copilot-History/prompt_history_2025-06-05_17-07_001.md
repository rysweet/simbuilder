# Prompt History - Session 2025-06-05_17-07_001

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-05 17:07)

**Prompt**: Context: We now have an updated TenantDiscoveryMVP spec with a full "Local Development
Environment" section, shared `.venv` strategy, environment-variable table, and docker-compose
requirements. Next step is to implement the shared project bootstrap/scaffolding so that all later
components can rely on common utilities, dependency management, and CI/lint config.

**Response**:

- Set up prompt history tracking file
- Create scaffolding package in `src/scaffolding/` with config, logging, CLI, and exceptions modules
- Implement root-level Python toolchain with pyproject.toml, ruff.toml, mypy.ini, pre-commit config
- Create docker-compose.yaml with Neo4j, NATS, and Azurite services
- Add tasks.py for project management commands
- Create unit tests for configuration loading
- Ensure all linting and type checking passes

## Prompt 12 (2025-06-06)

**Prompt**: Context: Specifications were just updated to add global session ID (UUID v4) generated
at launch, environment variables: SIMBUILDER_SESSION_ID, COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, dynamic free-port
allocation via a PortManager, .env.session written with all chosen ports, new CLI commands: sim
session create | list | status | cleanup. Repository layout: src/scaffolding currently contains
basic config & CLI. docker-compose.yaml is still static. Scope: 1. In src/scaffolding/: Add
port_manager.py with PortManager that scans for free ports in configurable range (defaults
30000-40000), persists chosen ports in memory and exposes get_port(service_name). Extend config.py
(or new module session.py) to generate SIMBUILDER_SESSION_ID (uuid4) and shortened 8-char version
for names, derive COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME = simbuilder-${session_short}, collect dynamic ports for
required services using PortManager, write .env.session file with all env vars & ports. 2. Update
cli.py: Implement sim session create → initializes new session, prints summary (& path of
.env.session), sim session list, sim session status <id>, and sim session cleanup <id> (cleanup
stops containers with matching name suffix and frees ports file). 3. Ensure logging messages note
session id. 4. Do not yet modify docker-compose.yaml (separate task). 5. Add unit tests in
tests/scaffolding/ for PortManager and session CLI. Constraints: Only edit/add code & tests as
listed above. No spec/docs edits. Follow existing code style, type-hint, and keep mypy/ruff happy.
Completion criteria: All new/changed files compile & unit tests pass (pytest -q), and sim session
create produces valid .env.session with unique ports.

**Response**: • Reading current scaffolding code structure to understand existing patterns •
Creating port_manager.py with PortManager class for dynamic port allocation • Creating session.py
module for session management with UUID generation and .env.session creation • Updating cli.py to
add session subcommands (create, list, status, cleanup) • Adding comprehensive logging with session
IDs throughout the system • Creating unit tests for PortManager and session CLI functionality

## Prompt 13 (2025-06-06)

**Prompt**: Context: The specs now require session-aware container names and dynamic ports supplied
via `.env.session`. Scaffolding/CLI & PortManager are finished and write `.env.session` containing
SIMBUILDER_SESSION_ID, COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, and per-service PORT variables. docker-compose.yaml is
still static with fixed ports and names. Devcontainer (if any) has no Docker-in-Docker settings yet.
Objective: 1. Refactor `docker-compose.yaml` into a session-aware version that loads environment
from `.env.session`, removes hard-coded container names, replaces fixed ports with dynamic ones,
adds shared network, and ensures volume names are project-specific. 2. Add helper in `session.py`
for compose_up()/compose_down() that wraps docker compose commands and integrate into CLI session
create with optional --start-containers flag. 3. Create/update devcontainer with Docker-in-Docker
feature and setup. 4. Update tests to mock docker calls and verify compose commands.

**Response**: • Ensuring all code follows type hints and passes mypy/ruff validation

## Prompt 14 (2025-06-06 15:23)

**Prompt**: Bring `.gitignore` up to current best-practice defaults for a Python project while
preserving any repo-specific entries and adding session exclusions. **Response**:

- Read existing `.gitignore` to catalogue current custom patterns
- Planned merge with GitHub’s `Python.gitignore` template, retaining all repo-specific lines
- Will add exclusions for `.env.session`, `.sessions/`, and `*.coverage`
- Ensure Docker artefacts (`__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `*.egg-info/`, `dist/`, `build/`, etc.)
  remain covered
- Next: overwrite `.gitignore` with consolidated content, deduplicated and logically grouped, then
  run ruff/mypy/tests
