# Prompt History - Session 2025-06-05_17-07_001

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-05 17:07)
**Prompt**: Context: We now have an updated TenantDiscoveryMVP spec with a full "Local Development Environment" section, shared `.venv` strategy, environment-variable table, and docker-compose requirements. Next step is to implement the shared project bootstrap/scaffolding so that all later components can rely on common utilities, dependency management, and CI/lint config.

**Response**: 
- Set up prompt history tracking file
- Create scaffolding package in `src/scaffolding/` with config, logging, CLI, and exceptions modules
- Implement root-level Python toolchain with pyproject.toml, ruff.toml, mypy.ini, pre-commit config
- Create docker-compose.yaml with Neo4j, NATS, and Azurite services
- Add tasks.py for project management commands
- Create unit tests for configuration loading
- Ensure all linting and type checking passes
