## Prompt 1 (2025-06-07 16:16 UTC)
- **Prompt**: Context: The "initial-impl" branch now contains safe, file-locked port/session management (see PR #1). We must begin implementing the "Tenant Discovery MVP", whose high-level requirements are documented in specs/TenantDiscoveryMVP.md and specs/components/23-tenant-discovery-agent/tenant-discovery-agent.md. Scope: Read the two spec files plus any other relevant component specs they reference. Produce an implementation blueprint that includes functional overview, service boundaries/modules, data flow, external dependencies, initial public API, test strategy, and incremental delivery plan. DO NOT write code; output the blueprint in markdown (docs/tenant_discovery_plan.md). Work ONLY within this architectural scope.
- **Response**:
  - Created new prompt history file for this architect session
  - Read TenantDiscoveryMVP.md specification detailing 9-phase implementation plan
  - Read tenant-discovery-agent.md specification with detailed requirements and interfaces
  - Read supporting component specifications (Graph Database, LLM Foundry, Core API Service)
  - Asked clarifying question about scope - user confirmed comprehensive infrastructure guidance needed
  - Created comprehensive implementation blueprint in docs/tenant_discovery_plan.md covering:
    - Functional overview of Azure tenant discovery system
    - Modular service boundaries with clear file structure under src/simbuilder/
    - Event-driven data flow architecture with Mermaid diagram
    - External dependency management and mocking strategies
    - Initial public API surface for REST endpoints and Python classes
    - Comprehensive test strategy (unit, integration, e2e) with live service requirements
    - 9-phase incremental delivery plan with weekly milestones and acceptance criteria
    - Key architectural decisions and risk mitigation strategies

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-07 17:08 UTC)
- **Prompt**: PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION â€“ Tenant Discovery Configuration Service with goals to provide robust config layer, expose Typer CLI with tdcli commands, ensure all tests pass
- **Response**:
  - Updated prompt history file with new entry
  - Will implement tenant_discovery package structure with config.py and cli.py
  - Will create Pydantic BaseSettings for Azure config with validators
  - Will implement Typer CLI with info/check commands
  - Will add comprehensive tests and ensure quality gates pass
  - Will commit and push changes to initial-impl branch
