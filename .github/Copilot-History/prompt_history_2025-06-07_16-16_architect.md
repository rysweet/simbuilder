## Prompt 1 (2025-06-07 16:16 UTC)

- **Prompt**: Context: The "initial-impl" branch now contains safe, file-locked port/session
  management (see PR #1). We must begin implementing the "Tenant Discovery MVP", whose high-level
  requirements are documented in specs/TenantDiscoveryMVP.md and
  specs/components/23-tenant-discovery-agent/tenant-discovery-agent.md. Scope: Read the two spec
  files plus any other relevant component specs they reference. Produce an implementation blueprint
  that includes functional overview, service boundaries/modules, data flow, external dependencies,
  initial public API, test strategy, and incremental delivery plan. DO NOT write code; output the
  blueprint in markdown (docs/tenant_discovery_plan.md). Work ONLY within this architectural scope.
- **Response**:
  - Created new prompt history file for this architect session
  - Read TenantDiscoveryMVP.md specification detailing 9-phase implementation plan
  - Read tenant-discovery-agent.md specification with detailed requirements and interfaces
  - Read supporting component specifications (Graph Database, LLM Foundry, Core API Service)
  - Asked clarifying question about scope - user confirmed comprehensive infrastructure guidance
    needed
  - Created comprehensive implementation blueprint in docs/tenant_discovery_plan.md covering:
    - Functional overview of Azure tenant discovery system
    - Modular service boundaries with clear file structure under src/simbuilder/
    - Event-driven data flow architecture with Mermaid diagram
    - External dependency management and mocking strategies
    - Initial public API surface for REST endpoints and Python classes
    - Comprehensive test strategy (unit, integration, e2e) with live service requirements
    - 9-phase incremental delivery plan with weekly milestones and acceptance criteria
    - Key architectural decisions and risk mitigation strategies

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-07 17:08 UTC)

- **Prompt**: PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION â€“ Tenant Discovery Configuration Service with goals to provide
  robust config layer, expose Typer CLI with tdcli commands, ensure all tests pass
- **Response**:
  - Updated prompt history file with new entry
  - Will implement tenant_discovery package structure with config.py and cli.py
  - Will create Pydantic BaseSettings for Azure config with validators
  - Will implement Typer CLI with info/check commands
  - Will add comprehensive tests and ensure quality gates pass
  - Will commit and push changes to initial-impl branch

## Prompt 3 (2025-06-09 01:52 UTC)

- **Prompt**: Phase 3 (Service Bus Integration) is complete and merged into the code-base. We now
  proceed directly to Phase 4 of the Tenant Discovery MVP implementation plan: Spec Library
  Integration. Create shared package `src/simbuilder_specs/` that manages external Liquid prompt
  templates used by all agents.
- **Response**:
  - Updated prompt history with current task (Phase 4 - Spec Library Integration)
  - Will implement shared package `src/simbuilder_specs/` with core modules: git_repository.py,
    template_loader.py, spec_validator.py, models.py
  - Will create CLI interface with Typer commands: specs info, specs pull, specs validate, specs
    render
  - Will extend scaffolding config.py with spec_repo_url and spec_repo_branch fields
  - Will implement comprehensive test suite with 90%+ coverage using local fixtures
  - Will add liquid dependency to requirements.txt
  - Will ensure Ruff & MyPy clean with no external network calls in tests
