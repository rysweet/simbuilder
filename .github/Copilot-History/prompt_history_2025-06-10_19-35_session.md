## Prompt 1 (2025-06-10 19:49)

**Prompt**: TASK: Achieve a completely green test suite and clean checks. CONTEXT: Failures still
reported after previous merges (exact failing tests unclear in main). Closed PRs #7, #9 contained
fixes that never landed; environment handling and template-loader path mocks may still be off.
Pre-commit and mypy errors surfaced intermittently. OBJECTIVES: 1. Diagnose current state, 2. Create
a clear list of distinct failure categories, 3. Fix all remaining issues iteratively, 4.
Verification: full pytest -q passes, pre-commit run --all-files exits 0, 5. GitHub workflow for each
logical fix, 6. Final attempt_completion must summarise all issues/PRs merged, test suite status,
static checks clean, and notable architectural decisions.

**Response**: • Created .github/Copilot-History directory structure • Initialized prompt history
file for session tracking • About to update shell history and begin diagnostic phase • Will run
pytest -q and static analysis tools to identify current failures • Plan to categorize issues and
create focused fix branches • Will follow GitHub workflow with issues/PRs for each logical fix
