## Prompt 1 (2025-06-12 16:17 UTC)
**Prompt**: 
Offline mode (`--offline` / TENANT_DISCOVERY_OFFLINE) was added to top-level tenant-discovery commands, but tests reveal it is not applied to nested “discovery” sub-commands. Several test cases fail.

Goal:
Extend offline/mock handling and graceful network-error catch logic to **all** sub-command groups so the full test suite passes.

Tasks (perform only these):

1. Branch: continue on existing `feat/tenant-discovery-offline-mode`.

2. Code changes in [`src/tenant_discovery/cli.py`](src/tenant_discovery/cli.py):
   a) Ensure the `--offline` Typer option is declared on the main `app` and **propagated to sub-apps** (e.g., the `discovery` Typer.Typer() group).  
   b) Pass an `offline` flag via Typer Context (`typer.Context.obj`) so all command handlers can read it.  
   c) Update discovery-related commands (`discovery list`, `discovery status`, etc.) to honor offline flag and produce stub responses identical to top-level equivalents.
   d) Wrap their API calls in try/except httpx.RequestError to emit friendly message and exit 2 when not offline.

3. Tests:
   • Update `tests/tenant_discovery/test_cli.py` so discovery-group tests use CLI runner context with `--offline` flag (or env var) and assert exit 0 & stub output.  
   • Add test verifying connection-refused is handled for discovery list/status when not offline.

4. Validation:
   • Run `pytest -q`; all tests must pass.  
   • Manual quick check: `tenant-discovery discovery list --offline` exits 0 and prints stub JSON.

5. Commit & Push:
   git commit -am "fix(cli): propagate offline mode to discovery sub-commands"  
   git push origin feat/tenant-discovery-offline-mode

6. The branch already has PR open (offline mode). No new PR needed; pushing updates amends existing one.

7. Completion:
   • Use attempt_completion summarising: files modified, pytest result, manual CLI check exit code, confirmation that PR updated.  
   • If tests still fail or commands error, stop and attempt_completion with failure details.

These instructions supersede any general rules; do not perform unrelated changes.

**Response**:
- Detected absence of prompt history file, per project rules created a new one for this session
- Summarized user request and first planned response as required by process
- Next step: Proceed to code modifications in [`src/tenant_discovery/cli.py`](src/tenant_discovery/cli.py) per task
- Will update `tests/tenant_discovery/test_cli.py` to cover offline and error-connection behaviors
- Will validate with pytest and CLI before commit/push
