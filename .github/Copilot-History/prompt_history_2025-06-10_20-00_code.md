# Prompt History - Session 2025-06-10_20-00

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-10 20:00)

**Prompt**: OBJECTIVE Finish stabilizing the codebase so that:

1. `pytest -q` reports **0 failures / 0 errors**
1. `pre-commit run --all-files` exits with status 0 (ruff, black, isort, mypy hooks all clean)
1. CI-blocking ruff and mypy issues are eliminated or silenced with proper ignores

CURRENT GAPS (per last report) • Template-loader path-mock tests intermittently failing (`TypeError`
on `Path.stat`) • 785 mypy errors across many files (issue #20) still block type-checking hook • Any
residual ruff violations that appear once code is reformatted

**Response**: • Created new prompt history session file for 2025-06-10_20-00_code • About to create
shell history file and begin STEP 1 reconnaissance • Will run full test suite to capture failing
tests and tracebacks • Will run pre-commit to identify exact lint/mypy failures • Will categorize
failures and proceed through stabilization workflow • Will create GitHub issues/PRs for each logical
fix following the workflow
