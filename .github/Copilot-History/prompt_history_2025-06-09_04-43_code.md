# Prompt History - Session: 2025-06-09_04-43_code

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-09 22:21:03 UTC)

**Prompt**: Create a detailed, sequential roadmap to implement Phases 7 through 24 of the SimBuilder project, ready for a new branch/PR.

Include for EACH phase:
1. Objective & scope (1-2 sentences)  
2. Key components/files to add or modify  
3. External dependencies or integrations  
4. Test strategy (unit, integration, e2e)  
5. Milestone acceptance criteria  
6. Estimated effort (S/M/L)

Also provide:
• Recommended branch naming convention  
• Suggested PR breakdown (how to group phases logically)  
• Risk & dependency matrix across phases  
• High-level timeline/Gantt ordering (which phases can proceed in parallel vs. must be sequential)

Keep the roadmap in markdown, suitable for inclusion in `/docs/phase7-24_roadmap.md`.  
Do NOT start coding—planning only.  
Signal completion with attempt_completion.

**Response**:
- Creating prompt history file as required by project rules
- Examined project specifications and component dependencies for phases 7-24
- Analyzed existing implementation (phases 1-6 complete with 346 passing tests)
- Understanding scope: Phase 7=Clarifier Agent through Phase 24=Config Service
- Creating comprehensive roadmap with effort estimates, dependencies, and PR strategy

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-09 22:35:51 UTC)

**Prompt**: 
Start Phase 7 – Clarifier Agent implementation in new branch `feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent`.

Initial scope (Sprint 1)
────────────────────────
1. Branch & boilerplate
   • `git switch -c feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent`
   • Update pyproject with `simbuilder_clarifier` extra (no deps yet)

2. Package skeleton under `src/clarifier_agent/`
   • `__init__.py` – expose `ClarifierAgent`
   • `agent.py`   – class scaffold with `clarify(spec: Spec) -> ClarifiedSpec`
   • `models.py`  – Pydantic models: `ClarifyRequest`, `ClarifyResponse`
   • `cli.py`     – Typer CLI `clarifier clarify <spec-file>`

3. Tests (red-green TDD start)
   • `tests/clarifier_agent/test_agent.py`
   • `tests/clarifier_agent/test_cli.py`
     – Simple happy-path stubs using sample YAML spec + asserts.

4. Docs
   • Append design snippet to `docs/phase7-24_roadmap.md` ➜ “Phase 7 Sprint 1 done”.

5. CI integration
   • Update `pytest` discovery path if needed.
   • Ensure `ruff`, `mypy` sections include new package.

Deliverables this PR
────────────────────
– New branch pushed  
– All new files compile & unit tests green (still minimal)  
– Entry-points updated (`clarifier-cli`) but no heavy logic yet.

Implement only scaffolding; real logic will follow in Sprint 2.

After coding:
 • `pytest -q` green  
 • Commit “feat(clarifier): scaffold agent, CLI, tests – sprint1”  
 • Push branch & open draft PR `gh pr create -B main -H feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent -t "Phase 7: Clarifier Agent – Sprint 1 Scaffolding" -b "Adds initial package skeleton, CLI, and placeholder tests."`

Update shell history accordingly.

Begin now.

**Response**:
- Read current prompt history and determined next entry number for compliance
- Parsed detailed requirements for Phase 7 Clarifier Agent Sprint 1 (branch, skeleton, CLI, tests, docs, CI, PR)
- Planned step-by-step execution: branch, pyproject update, scaffolding under src/clarifier_agent/, test stubs in tests/, CLI Typer entry, doc note, ruff/mypy/pytest config
- Will verify prompt history update before any shell or coding step as required by project rules
- Next: Create new branch and update shell history accordingly
## Prompt 3 (2025-06-09 22:41:48 UTC)

**Prompt**: 
Begin Phase 7 – Clarifier Agent sprint-1 scaffolding on new branch feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent.

Required actions
────────────────
1. Checkout new branch
   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent
   ```

2. Update pyproject.toml
   • Add clarifier-agent package under `[tool.poetry]` packages or `[project]` (depending on current format).  
   • Add optional extra `clarifier`.

3. Create package skeleton
   • src/clarifier_agent/__init__.py → expose `ClarifierAgent`  
   • src/clarifier_agent/agent.py     → class ClarifierAgent with stub clarify()  
   • src/clarifier_agent/models.py    → Pydantic ClarifyRequest / ClarifyResponse  
   • src/clarifier_agent/cli.py       → Typer app `clarifier-cli` with clarify cmd.

4. Tests
   • tests/clarifier_agent/test_agent.py – instantiate agent, call clarify(stub), assert placeholder.  
   • tests/clarifier_agent/test_cli.py   – Typer CliRunner invoke clarify, assert exit-code 0.

5. Docs
   • Append “Phase 7 Sprint 1 scaffolding complete” to docs/phase7-24_roadmap.md.

6. Tooling
   • Ensure ruff, mypy include new package if config lists explicit paths.

7. Verify green
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```

8. Commit & push
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(clarifier): scaffold agent, CLI, tests – sprint 1"
   git push -u origin feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent
   ```

9. Open draft PR
   ```bash
   gh pr create -B main -H feature/phase-07-clarifier-agent \
     -t "Phase 7: Clarifier Agent – Sprint 1 Scaffolding" \
     -b "Adds initial Clarifier Agent package skeleton, CLI, placeholder tests and doc update."
   ```

10. Update shell history file with every command run and commit it.

Follow existing coding standards; minimal logic only. When done, run all tests, then use attempt_completion summarizing scaffold creation and showing `pytest -q` demo command.

**Response**:
- Read previous prompt history and determined Prompt 3 is next
- Outlined steps: create/switch to new branch, update pyproject.toml, create clarifier_agent package skeleton, add stub tests, update docs, update ruff/mypy config if explicit, verify tests green, commit, push, open draft PR
- Will document and commit every shell command to shell history file according to strict project rules
- Will verify history files are updated after each user interaction/command and before moving to next step
- Will run all tests at completion and show demo pytest -q output via attempt_completion
- Will follow all coding standards, minimal logic only as requested
- Ready to begin stepwise Phase 7 scaffolding process now
