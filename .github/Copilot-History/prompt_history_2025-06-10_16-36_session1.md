## Prompt 1 (2025-06-10 16:36 UTC)
**Prompt**: <task>
You must create a demonstration document for using SimBuilder’s tenant discovery feature, verifying every step as you go.

CONTEXT
• The user has updated the .env file with a tenant we must use.
• CLI entry-point is in src/tenant_discovery/cli.py.
• Existing specs live under docs/ and specs/components/23-tenant-discovery-agent/.
• A planning doc already exists at docs/tenant_discovery_plan.md.

SCOPE (strict — do nothing outside this list)
1. Read the .env file and extract whichever variable(s) the CLI needs (likely AZURE_TENANT_ID or similar).  
2. Review tenant-discovery–related code (src/tenant_discovery/** and any referenced modules) to understand required commands/flags.  
3. Create a new markdown file docs/tenant_discovery_demo.md that:  
   • Introduces the goal.  
   • Lists prerequisites (.env values set, GH CLI installed, etc.).  
   • Walks through each CLI step (login/auth if needed, discovery run, result inspection, etc.).  
   • Includes real command output blocks generated during your tests.  
4. As you draft each step, actually execute the command you’re documenting (use execute_command).  
   • Capture any errors.  
   • If a command fails or otherwise indicates a bug/missing feature, immediately:  
     a. Run `gh issue create` with an appropriate title/body to file the problem.  
     b. Create a new branch via `git switch -c fix/<slug>` and open a PR with `gh pr create` targeting main and referencing the issue.  
     c. Do NOT attempt to fix the bug in this sub-task; just file the issue & PR stub.  
5. Commit the finished docs file to a new branch demo/tenant-discovery-guide and open a PR (separate from any bug-fix PRs).  
6. Signal completion with attempt_completion, summarizing:  
   • Extracted tenant value  
   • Commands executed & success/failure tally  
   • Any issues/PRs opened (numbers & titles)  
   • Location of the new documentation file/PR.

NOTES
• Use write-tools to create/edit files.  
• Keep commits atomic: docs changes vs bug reports.  
• Follow repo contributing conventions (pre-commit, ruff lint, etc.).  
• These instructions supersede any conflicting general rules for code mode.  
• Conclude with attempt_completion as described above.

**Response**:
- Listed .github directory to ensure Copilot-History exists
- Read .env to extract AZURE_TENANT_ID=3cd87a41-1f61-4aef-a212-cefdecd9a2d1
- Planned next steps to review tenant discovery code and document
## Prompt 2 (2025-06-10 16:43 UTC)
**Prompt**: Tool result updates and environment details  
**Response**:
- Examined tenant discovery CLI (`src/tenant_discovery/cli.py`) and settings (`src/tenant_discovery/config.py`)  
- Reviewed component spec (`specs/components/23-tenant-discovery-agent/tenant-discovery-agent.md`) for context  
- Located entry point mapping in `pyproject.toml`  
- Executed `tdcli config info`; encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: pydantic` → identified packaging/dependency bug  
- Recorded command in shell history
## Prompt 3 (2025-06-10 16:59 UTC)
**Prompt**: Internal follow-up (history maintenance, commit, PR planning)  
**Response**:
- Added complete shell command history block capturing all executed commands  
- Staged and committed shell history on branch `fix/pydantic-dependency`  
- Verified `pydantic` still absent, confirming runtime dependency bug  
- Prepared to open draft PR referencing issue #3 and to author demo documentation on separate branch
## Prompt 4 (2025-06-10 17:30 UTC)
**Prompt**: STEP 1: Gather baseline data for the tenant-discovery demo.
**Response**:
- Parsed .env and captured tenant-related variable `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- Inspected [`src/tenant_discovery/cli.py`](relative/src/tenant_discovery/cli.py:1) and found main command `tdcli` with `config` sub-commands (`info`, `check`)
- Located entry-point mapping `tdcli = "src.tenant_discovery.cli:app"` in [`pyproject.toml`](relative/pyproject.toml:44)
- Executed `python -m src.tenant_discovery.cli --help`, received `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'` (exit code 1); captured full stderr/stdout
- All baseline data gathered; ready to summarize for orchestrator
