## Prompt 1 (2025-06-10 16:36 UTC)

**Prompt**: <task> You must create a demonstration document for using SimBuilder’s tenant discovery
feature, verifying every step as you go.

CONTEXT • The user has updated the .env file with a tenant we must use. • CLI entry-point is in
src/tenant_discovery/cli.py. • Existing specs live under docs/ and
specs/components/23-tenant-discovery-agent/. • A planning doc already exists at
docs/tenant_discovery_plan.md.

SCOPE (strict — do nothing outside this list)

1. Read the .env file and extract whichever variable(s) the CLI needs (likely AZURE_TENANT_ID or
   similar).
1. Review tenant-discovery–related code (src/tenant_discovery/\*\* and any referenced modules) to
   understand required commands/flags.
1. Create a new markdown file docs/tenant_discovery_demo.md that: • Introduces the goal. • Lists
   prerequisites (.env values set, GH CLI installed, etc.). • Walks through each CLI step
   (login/auth if needed, discovery run, result inspection, etc.). • Includes real command output
   blocks generated during your tests.
1. As you draft each step, actually execute the command you’re documenting (use execute_command). •
   Capture any errors. • If a command fails or otherwise indicates a bug/missing feature,
   immediately: a. Run `gh issue create` with an appropriate title/body to file the problem. b.
   Create a new branch via `git switch -c fix/<slug>` and open a PR with `gh pr create` targeting
   main and referencing the issue. c. Do NOT attempt to fix the bug in this sub-task; just file the
   issue & PR stub.
1. Commit the finished docs file to a new branch demo/tenant-discovery-guide and open a PR (separate
   from any bug-fix PRs).
1. Signal completion with attempt_completion, summarizing: • Extracted tenant value • Commands
   executed & success/failure tally • Any issues/PRs opened (numbers & titles) • Location of the new
   documentation file/PR.

NOTES • Use write-tools to create/edit files. • Keep commits atomic: docs changes vs bug reports. •
Follow repo contributing conventions (pre-commit, ruff lint, etc.). • These instructions supersede
any conflicting general rules for code mode. • Conclude with attempt_completion as described above.

**Response**:

- Listed .github directory to ensure Copilot-History exists
- Read .env to extract AZURE_TENANT_ID=3cd87a41-1f61-4aef-a212-cefdecd9a2d1
- Planned next steps to review tenant discovery code and document

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-10 16:43 UTC)

**Prompt**: Tool result updates and environment details **Response**:

- Examined tenant discovery CLI (`src/tenant_discovery/cli.py`) and settings
  (`src/tenant_discovery/config.py`)
- Reviewed component spec (`specs/components/23-tenant-discovery-agent/tenant-discovery-agent.md`)
  for context
- Located entry point mapping in `pyproject.toml`
- Executed `tdcli config info`; encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: pydantic` → identified
  packaging/dependency bug
- Recorded command in shell history

## Prompt 3 (2025-06-10 16:59 UTC)

**Prompt**: Internal follow-up (history maintenance, commit, PR planning) **Response**:

- Added complete shell command history block capturing all executed commands
- Staged and committed shell history on branch `fix/pydantic-dependency`
- Verified `pydantic` still absent, confirming runtime dependency bug
- Prepared to open draft PR referencing issue #3 and to author demo documentation on separate branch

## Prompt 4 (2025-06-10 17:30 UTC)

**Prompt**: STEP 1: Gather baseline data for the tenant-discovery demo. **Response**:

- Parsed .env and captured tenant-related variable `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- Inspected [`src/tenant_discovery/cli.py`](relative/src/tenant_discovery/cli.py:1) and found main
  command `tdcli` with `config` sub-commands (`info`, `check`)
- Located entry-point mapping `tdcli = "src.tenant_discovery.cli:app"` in
  [`pyproject.toml`](relative/pyproject.toml:44)
- Executed `python -m src.tenant_discovery.cli --help`, received
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'` (exit code 1); captured full stderr/stdout
- All baseline data gathered; ready to summarize for orchestrator

## Prompt 5 (2025-06-10 18:05 UTC)

**Prompt**: <task> Resolve failing test
`tests/simbuilder_api/test_health_router.py::TestHealthRouter::test_health_check_endpoint`
(AssertionError: expected environment “development”, got “test”).

OBJECTIVE Align the health-check response so it reports the correct environment in both production
runtime and test context.

TASKS (strict order):

1. Re-run the single failing test to capture actual JSON returned and full traceback.

1. Inspect: •
   [`src/simbuilder_api/routers/health.py`](relative/src/simbuilder_api/routers/health.py:1) •
   [`src/scaffolding/config.py`](relative/src/scaffolding/config.py:1) Determine how the
   “environment” field is populated (env var, default, etc.).

1. Implement fix so that: • In normal runs it reflects the value of `SIMBUILDER_ENVIRONMENT` (or
   similar) if set, otherwise defaults to “development”. • In tests, overriding that setting via
   `monkeypatch` or env var should yield the expected value (“test”), making the assertion pass.

1. Add/adjust unit tests if required (but keep scope minimal).

1. Verification • Run only this failing test – it must pass. • Run full `pytest -q`; failure count
   should drop from 7 → 6.

1. GitHub workflow • Create issue: “Health router returns wrong environment value”. • Branch:
   `fix/health-router-env`. • Commit message: “fix: correct environment value in health endpoint
   (#<issue-number>)”. • Push & open draft PR: “Draft: fix health-check environment (fixes
   #<issue-number>)”.

1. Run `pre-commit run --all-files`; fix any new lint errors.

1. attempt_completion summary must include: • Passing status of the specific test and new suite
   failure count. • Issue & PR URLs/numbers. • Commit SHA pushed. • Implementation notes (env var
   name chosen, default logic, etc.).

NOTES • Do not tackle the remaining graph/CLI config failures in this task. • Keep changes minimal
and focused. • These instructions override default rules. • Finish with attempt_completion. </task>

**Response**:

- Located latest prompt history file and determined next prompt number is 5.
- Will re-run the single failing test to capture actual response JSON and traceback.
- Plan to inspect implementation and apply minimal, focused fix per step 2 of user’s instructions.
- Will maintain all project history files strictly per requirements.
- Will document all shell commands after running them.
- Will not tackle other failures or changes outside scope.

## Prompt 6 (2025-06-10 18:08 UTC)

**Prompt**: FINALIZE Health-router fix branch and address pre-commit loop.

OBJECTIVE Complete branch `fix/health-router-env`, ensure pre-commit passes cleanly, push the
branch, and open PR referencing Issue #8.

STEPS (execute strictly in order)

1. Re-enable the virtualenv if needed, then run pre-commit manually.
1. Resolve formatting loop and commit changes, adjusting config if needed.
1. Confirm health-router test passes.
1. Commit results, push, and open PR.
1. attempt_completion per detailed summary requirements.

NOTES • Do NOT tackle graph/CLI failures here. • Keep changes minimal, focused, and
attempt_completion as final step.

**Response**:

- Located latest prompt history
  `.github/Copilot-History/prompt_history_2025-06-10_16-36_session1.md`, next prompt is 6
- Ready to activate virtualenv if needed, run `pre-commit run --all-files`, and capture formatting
  loop/changes
- Plan to fix config or commit as necessary to stabilize formatting, per Black/Ruff pre-commit
  behavior
- Will ensure
  `tests/simbuilder_api/test_health_router.py::TestHealthRouter::test_health_check_endpoint` passes
  and summarize outcome
- Will push fix/health-router-env and open PR as described in the prompt
- Will ensure all detailed reporting (pre-commit, test pass, PR URL, SHA, failure count) in the
  final attempt_completion
