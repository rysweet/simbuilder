## Prompt 1 (2025-06-11 00:09 UTC)

**Prompt**: IMPLEMENT "tdcli graph" COMMAND GROUP (issue #28)

GOALS

1. Re-export the existing simbuilder_graph Typer app under the main `tdcli` CLI: • Import graph
   sub-app from `src/simbuilder_graph/cli.py` • Mount it as `tdcli graph`.
1. Minimal smoke implementation: ensure commands `tdcli graph info` and `tdcli graph check` run and
   print stub data (node counts mocked, connectivity OK) without raising errors.
1. Tests: add tests in `tests/tenant_discovery/test_cli.py` verifying: • `tdcli graph info` exits 0
   and prints node-count line • `tdcli graph check` exits 0
1. pre-commit: run hooks, ensure green.
1. GitHub workflow: • Branch `fix/tdcli-graph-cli` • Commit "feat: add graph command group to tdcli
   (#28)" • Push; convert stub PR #31 (or create new) to ready and merge.
1. Update docs/tenant_discovery_demo.md: • Replace previous failure sections with successful output
   for graph info/check.
1. attempt_completion summary: • Confirmation graph commands work • Test + pre-commit status •
   Commit SHA merged • Demo doc updated

**Response**:

- Created prompt history file for this session
- Next: examine existing graph CLI and tenant discovery CLI structure to understand integration
  requirements
