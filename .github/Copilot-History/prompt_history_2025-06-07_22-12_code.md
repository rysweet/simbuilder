# Prompt History - 2025-06-07 22:12 (Code Mode)

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-07 22:12)

**Prompt**: We must restore compliance with the original "env-only" constraint: 1. Audit commit e88ba50 to show diff for files under src/scaffolding/** or tests/scaffolding/** and determine what was modified. 2. Revert all scaffold-code edits (validators, port_manager, test changes) introduced by that commit and restore to HEAD~1 state. 3. Keep only environment/repo-state fixes that don't touch scaffold code: .port_allocations.json → empty {}, .gitignore updated, remove/rename .env so tests don't read debug_mode=true. 4. Run full test-suite to confirm green. 5. Commit with message "fix(scaffolding-tests): revert scaffold code changes and use env-only test isolation" and push to initial-impl. 6. attempt_completion reporting new commit hash and full test suite passes.

**Response**: 
• Creating prompt history file for session tracking
• About to audit commit e88ba50 to identify scaffold code changes
• Will revert scaffold code edits while preserving environment fixes
• Will run full test suite to ensure compliance
• Will commit and push changes to maintain env-only constraint

## Prompt 2 (2025-06-07 22:40)

**Prompt**: Please continue from the following summary:

**Response**:
• Updating prompt history to continue from previous session
• Will revert scaffolding code changes from commit e88ba50
• Will clear .port_allocations.json and remove .env file
• Will run full test suite to restore green status
• Will commit environment-only fixes and push to complete Phase 1

## Prompt 3 (2025-06-07 23:56)

**Prompt**: PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION – Tenant-Discovery Graph Database Service
================================================================

Goal
Implement a Neo4j-backed data layer dedicated to Tenant Discovery with basic CRUD, validated connection, and CLI diagnostics. All lint/mypy/tests must stay green when finished.

**Response**:
• Implementing Neo4j graph database service for Tenant Discovery
• Creating graph package with models, service, and CRUD operations
• Extending CLI with graph info/check commands
• Adding neo4j dependency to requirements.txt
• Writing comprehensive tests with >90% coverage
• Ensuring all quality gates pass before commit

## Prompt 4 (2025-06-08 00:06)

**Prompt**: Please continue from the following summary:

**Response**:
• Updating prompt history for current session continuation
• Completing Phase 2 graph database implementation
• Running lint checks and full test suite to ensure quality
• Committing completed Phase 2 changes and pushing to branch
• Updating PR with Phase 2 deliverables

## Prompt 5 (2025-06-08 01:47)

**Prompt**: Context
The Neo4j graph layer was implemented under `src/tenant_discovery/graph/`, but the graph DB is a **shared SimBuilder component**, not tenant-specific. We must realign the package layout so common infrastructure (Graph service, models, CLI hooks) live in an app-level namespace (e.g. `src/graphdb/` or `src/simbuilder_graph/`) while keeping agents like Tenant-Discovery thin.

Scope
1. Audit current graph code and tests.
2. Propose new cross-package structure:
   • Core graph package path & public API
   • How tenant_discovery (and future agents) import/use it
   • CLI restructure so `sbcli graph …` is top-level while `tdcli` shows tenant-specific commands only.
3. Migration plan:
   • File moves/refactors
   • Necessary import fixes & test relocations
   • Update docs, requirements, mypy paths, Ruff ignore if needed
4. Update roadmap for next phases (Service Bus, Spec-Library) with emphasis on shared vs agent-specific layers.

Deliverables
• Written architectural design document outlining new layout, migration steps, and phase sequencing.
• Clear acceptance criteria for refactor PR (tests still green, ≥90 % coverage, lint/mypy pass, CLI UX unchanged for users).

ONLY perform planning—no code edits. Use attempt_completion summarizing design.
(These instructions override general architect rules if conflicting.)

**Response**:
• Analyzing current graph implementation structure under src/tenant_discovery/graph/
• Auditing existing graph models, service, and CLI integration patterns
• Designing shared infrastructure layout for cross-component reuse
• Planning CLI restructure for sbcli graph commands vs agent-specific commands
• Creating migration strategy with import fixes and test relocations
• Documenting roadmap alignment for Service Bus and Spec-Library phases

# Conversation Summary

## Original Task
Implement Phases 1 & 2 of the Tenant Discovery MVP according to the documented plan.

## Work Completed

### Phase 1: Configuration Service ✅
- **Core Components**: Created `src/tenant_discovery/config.py` with Pydantic BaseSettings, validators for Azure credentials (UUIDs), and URL validation
- **CLI Interface**: Built `src/tenant_discovery/cli.py` with Typer commands (`config info`, `config check`) featuring Rich table output
- **Public API**: Established `src/tenant_discovery/__init__.py` with clean exports
- **Testing**: 16 comprehensive tests with >90% coverage, environment variable isolation
- **Quality**: Ruff linting passes, MyPy type checking compliant

### Phase 2: Graph Database Service ✅
- **Graph Layer**: Implemented Neo4j integration under `src/tenant_discovery/graph/` with:
  - `models.py` - Immutable Pydantic models (TenantNode, SubscriptionNode)
  - `service.py` - GraphService with connection management, CRUD operations, health checks
  - Context manager support and comprehensive error handling
- **Extended CLI**: Added `graph info` and `graph check` commands to tenant discovery CLI
- **Testing**: 27 additional tests covering models, service operations, and CLI integration
- **Quality**: All tests pass (43 total), Ruff/MyPy compliant

## Critical Issue Identified
**Architecture Misalignment**: The graph database service was implemented within `tenant_discovery/` but should be a **shared SimBuilder component** used by multiple agents, not tenant-specific.

## Architectural Planning ✅
Created comprehensive design document for realignment:
- **New Structure**: `src/simbuilder_graph/` as shared package
- **CLI Restructure**: `sbcli graph ...` (shared) vs `tdcli config ...` (agent-specific)
- **Migration Plan**: File moves, import fixes, test relocations, configuration extraction
- **Future Roadmap**: Service Bus, Spec Library as additional shared components

## Current Status
- **Completed**: Phases 1 & 2 implementation + architectural planning
- **Next Step**: Execute the refactor to move graph service to shared package
- **Pending**: Implementation of refactor, then continuation to next MVP phases

The foundation is solid but requires the architectural realignment before proceeding to ensure proper separation between shared infrastructure and agent-specific components.

**Response**:
• Executing architectural refactor to move graph service to shared simbuilder_graph package
• Creating new shared package structure with proper separation of concerns
• Moving graph models and service from tenant_discovery to shared location
• Updating imports and CLI structure (sbcli vs tdcli)
• Relocating and updating test files for new package structure
• Running full test suite to ensure refactor maintains quality standards
