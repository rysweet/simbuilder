# Prompt History - 2025-06-07 22:12 (Code Mode)

## Prompt 1 (2025-06-07 22:12)

**Prompt**: We must restore compliance with the original "env-only" constraint: 1. Audit commit e88ba50 to show diff for files under src/scaffolding/** or tests/scaffolding/** and determine what was modified. 2. Revert all scaffold-code edits (validators, port_manager, test changes) introduced by that commit and restore to HEAD~1 state. 3. Keep only environment/repo-state fixes that don't touch scaffold code: .port_allocations.json → empty {}, .gitignore updated, remove/rename .env so tests don't read debug_mode=true. 4. Run full test-suite to confirm green. 5. Commit with message "fix(scaffolding-tests): revert scaffold code changes and use env-only test isolation" and push to initial-impl. 6. attempt_completion reporting new commit hash and full test suite passes.

**Response**: 
• Creating prompt history file for session tracking
• About to audit commit e88ba50 to identify scaffold code changes
• Will revert scaffold code edits while preserving environment fixes
• Will run full test suite to ensure compliance
• Will commit and push changes to maintain env-only constraint
