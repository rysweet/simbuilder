# Code Organization

## File and Module Structure

- Group related functionality in dedicated modules and packages
- Use a consistent file structure within modules
- Place interfaces in base.py files at the package root
- Use __init__.py files to expose public APIs
- Follow established naming conventions for files and directories
- Use clear and consistent naming for modules and packages

## Test Organization

- Organize tests in a parallel structure to the codebase
- Use descriptive names for test files and classes
- Group related test functionality in dedicated test modules
- Use clear and consistent naming for test methods

## Project Structure Guidelines

- Follow the module structure established in the codebase (shared, code_analysis, etc.)
- Maintain clear separation between different concerns
- Create dedicated directories for distinct functionality types
- Use consistent naming patterns across the project
