We are working on a project that will take a description of a cybersecurity incident or attack, and then using ai agents to reason about what infrastructure and simulated data are required to replicate a simulated environment in which we might be able to replicate that attack. For example, an enterprise email cross-tenant exfiltration attack might require an entrprise azure entraid setup, a dedicated tenant for the main ids and email, then another tenant for a different purpose such as support; then it will require some endpoints or accounts that have permissions in both tennants; it may require m365 email accounts, simulated email, deployed endpoints that can access the email, and so on. Another example is that an XSS privilege escalation may require an app deployed that is conected to a database and some javascript code that allows an xss payload to be run against the database. Our simulation environments will have some baseline requiremnets that can be specified in a configuration file in terms of the size and scope of the azure environment. The data flowwill start with an initial description of an attack, and if necessary the system we are building will ask the user questions about the attack until we understand enough to make a plan for the simulation resources required. Then system will review the plan with the user, and allow them to make adjustments. Once the plan is approved, infrastructure as code automation will be overseen by AI agents that will orchestrate building the infrastructure as code for creating the simulated environment and populating it with simuldated data. Our goal right now is to build a rough specification for this software system. Let's store it in specs/SimBuilderOverview.md. The specification should focus first on what the software should do: facilitate the automated planning and build-out of simulation of enterprise cloud environments to allow the replication of sophisticated attacks against customers. The second half of the specification can then cover *how* we will build this: using AI agents to reason over the request and plan a simulation, to generate valid and realistic configurations, and the ensure that the simulation has all the elements required to recreate an attack. 

After you have created the initial specification, I want you to use it to drive a role-play, in which on the one hand you take the role of a business analyst in a security team, attempting to deeply understand the requirements, and on the other hand you play the role of the product owner who has to deliver this enterprise cloud environment simulation tool. The Business Analyst will ask questions of the Product Owner, and you wil record the dialog in specs/QandA.md. You should run the dialog for at least twenty turns, generating more detail about the requirements. Once you have generated the QandA.md, you can then use it to make suggestions for improving the specs/SimBuilderOverview.md
