# Auto Cleanup Scheduler Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The Auto Cleanup Scheduler component manages the automated lifecycle and resource cleanup of
SimBuilder simulation environments. It enforces time-to-live (TTL) policies, monitors resource usage
patterns, implements cost-based cleanup triggers, and ensures complete resource decommissioning when
simulations are no longer needed. This component is critical for cost control, resource
optimization, and maintaining clean cloud environments by preventing resource sprawl and abandoned
simulations.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As a **Cost Manager**, I need automated cleanup of simulation resources when TTL expires to
  prevent unnecessary spending
- As an **Operations Team**, I need reliable resource cleanup that handles complex dependency chains
  and cleanup ordering
- As a **Project Manager**, I need configurable cleanup policies based on simulation type, usage
  patterns, and business requirements
- As a **Security Officer**, I need assured data destruction and resource cleanup to meet compliance
  requirements
- As a **Developer**, I need cleanup notifications and grace periods to extend simulations that are
  still actively used
- As an **Finance Team**, I need cleanup verification and reporting to ensure accurate cost
  allocation and budget compliance
- As a **System Administrator**, I need emergency cleanup capabilities for budget violations and
  resource limit breaches
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need audit trails of all cleanup activities and data destruction
  verification
