# Spec Library (Git Layer) Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The Spec Library provides version-controlled storage and management of simulation specifications, attack patterns, Infrastructure-as-Code templates, and deployment manifests. Built as a Git-based repository layer, it enables reproducible simulations, template sharing, collaborative specification development, and audit trails for all simulation artifacts. The library serves as the definitive source for simulation blueprints and enables simulation recreation from stored specifications.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As a **Planner Agent**, I need to store and retrieve attack pattern templates and resource plans for reuse across simulations
- As an **InfraSynthesis Agent**, I need to store and version IaC templates (Bicep, Terraform, ARM) generated for different scenarios
- As a **Core API Service**, I need to manage simulation specifications with full version history and branching
- As a **Security Researcher**, I need to share and collaborate on attack scenario specifications across teams
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need immutable audit trails of all simulation specifications and changes
- As a **Developer**, I need to recreate exact simulation environments from stored specifications
- As an **Operations Team**, I need to track specification lineage and impact analysis for changes

## Interfaces / APIs

### Inputs
- **Attack Specifications**: Structured YAML/JSON attack scenario definitions
- **Resource Plans**: Infrastructure resource definitions and dependency graphs
- **IaC Templates**: Bicep, Terraform, and ARM template files
- **Deployment Manifests**: Complete deployment configuration with parameters
- **Telemetry Schemas**: Monitoring and logging configuration specifications
- **Validation Scripts**: Environment validation and precondition checks

### Outputs
- **Specification Retrieval**: Versioned specifications by ID, tag, or branch
- **Template Libraries**: Categorized IaC templates and attack patterns
- **Diff Analysis**: Changes between specification versions
- **Dependency Maps**: Specification relationships and impact analysis
- **Audit Reports**: Change history and authorship tracking

### Public REST / gRPC / CLI commands
```
POST /specs/simulations - Create new simulation specification
PUT /specs/simulations/{id} - Update simulation specification
GET /specs/simulations/{id} - Retrieve simulation specification
GET /specs/simulations/{id}/versions - List specification versions
GET /specs/templates/attacks - List available attack pattern templates
GET /specs/templates/infrastructure - List IaC template library
POST /specs/templates - Add new template to library
GET /specs/audit/{simulation_id} - Get specification change history
```

## Dependencies

- **Git Repository**: Primary version control system (Azure DevOps, GitHub, or GitLab)
- **Core API Service**: Authentication and access control integration
- **Graph Database Service**: Specification metadata and relationship storage
- **Azure Storage**: Large artifact storage and backup
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated validation and template testing
- **Attack spec artifacts are not sensitive**: They are stored in plain text within the repository; standard Git access control applies.

## Documentation to Produce

- **Specification Schema Reference**: YAML/JSON schema documentation with examples
- **Template Development Guide**: Creating reusable attack and infrastructure templates
- **Version Control Workflow**: Branching, tagging, and release management procedures
- **API Integration Guide**: How services interact with the spec library
- **Template Library Catalog**: Organized catalog of available templates
- **Compliance and Audit Guide**: Audit trail management and compliance reporting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Git operations (clone, commit, push, pull, merge)
- Specification validation and schema compliance
- Template rendering and parameter substitution
- Version management and tagging
- Access control and permission validation
- File format parsing (YAML, JSON) and serialization

### Integration Tests
- **Live Git repository required** - no mocking of version control operations
- End-to-end specification storage and retrieval
- Template library management with real file operations
- Concurrent access and merge conflict resolution
- Large specification handling and performance
- CI/CD pipeline integration with actual template validation

### Acceptance Tests
- Complete simulation lifecycle with specification versioning
- Template sharing and reuse across multiple simulations
- Audit trail generation and compliance reporting
- Specification recreation and environment reproduction
- Collaborative editing with multiple users and branching

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Version Control**: Full Git history with branching, tagging, and merge capabilities
- **Performance**: Sub-second retrieval for specifications up to 100MB
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ specifications with 10+ versions each
- **Security**: Role-based access control with encrypted storage
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability with backup and disaster recovery
- **Compliance**: Immutable audit trails with digital signatures
- **Usability**: Intuitive API with comprehensive validation and error messages

## Open Questions

- Should we implement specification locking for concurrent editing scenarios?
- What branching strategy best supports collaborative specification development?
- How should we handle large binary artifacts (VM images, datasets) in specifications?
- Should we implement automatic specification validation pipelines on commit?
- What retention policy should we use for specification versions and history?
- How do we handle specification dependencies and circular references?
- Should we implement specification marketplace/sharing capabilities across organizations?
- What format should we use for specification encryption and digital signatures?
