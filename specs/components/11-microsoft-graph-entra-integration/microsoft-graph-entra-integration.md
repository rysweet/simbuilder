# Microsoft Graph Entra Integration Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The Microsoft Graph Entra Integration component provides comprehensive identity management capabilities for SimBuilder simulation environments. It manages synthetic user accounts, organizational structures, group memberships, application registrations, and authentication flows within Azure Active Directory. This component enables realistic simulation of enterprise identity scenarios for attack testing while maintaining proper isolation and security.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As a **DataSeeder Agent**, I need to create realistic organizational hierarchies with users, groups, and roles for attack simulations
- As a **Security Researcher**, I need synthetic identities with realistic permissions and group memberships to test attack paths
- As a **Red Team Member**, I need service principals and application registrations to simulate application-based attacks
- As a **Planner Agent**, I need to understand available identity services and their configuration options for simulation planning
- As a **Validator Agent**, I need to verify that identity configurations match attack scenario requirements
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need audit trails of all identity operations within simulation environments
- As a **Operations Team**, I need automated cleanup of synthetic identities when simulations are decommissioned
- As a **Attack Researcher**, I need realistic privilege escalation paths and delegation scenarios within tenant structures

## Interfaces / APIs

### Inputs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- User and group creation with various configurations
- Application registration and service principal management
- Permission assignment and role delegation logic
- Organizational hierarchy building and validation
- Credential generation and secure storage

### Integration Tests
- **Live Azure AD integration** - no mocking of Microsoft Graph APIs
- Complete organizational structure creation and verification
- Complex permission scenarios with nested groups and roles
- Authentication flow testing with real identity providers
- Cross-tenant identity isolation verification
- Large-scale identity population performance testing

### End-to-End Acceptance Tests
- Full simulation identity lifecycle from creation to cleanup
- Complex attack scenario identity requirements validation
- Integration with other SimBuilder components requiring identity services
