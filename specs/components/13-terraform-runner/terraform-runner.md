# Terraform Runner Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The Terraform Runner component executes Terraform infrastructure-as-code templates for SimBuilder
simulation environments. It manages Terraform state, workspace isolation, provider configurations,
and deployment orchestration while providing robust error handling, rollback capabilities, and
deployment monitoring. This component serves as the primary infrastructure deployment engine for
complex multi-resource Azure environments.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As an **Orchestrator Agent**, I need to deploy complex infrastructure using Terraform templates
  with proper state management
- As a **Planner Agent**, I need to validate Terraform configurations and estimate deployment costs
  before execution
- As an **Operations Team**, I need reliable rollback capabilities when deployments fail or
  environments need cleanup
- As a **Security Officer**, I need audit trails of all infrastructure deployments and state changes
- As a **Cost Manager**, I need real-time deployment progress and resource cost estimation during
  provisioning
- As a **Developer**, I need isolated Terraform workspaces for concurrent simulation deployments
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need validation that deployed infrastructure meets governance
  policies and standards
- As a **Support Engineer**, I need detailed deployment logs and error diagnostics for
  troubleshooting
