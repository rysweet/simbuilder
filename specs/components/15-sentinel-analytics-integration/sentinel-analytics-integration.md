# Sentinel Analytics Integration Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The Sentinel Analytics Integration component provides comprehensive security monitoring, telemetry collection, and attack detection validation for SimBuilder simulation environments. It configures Azure Sentinel workspaces, deploys detection rules, manages Log Analytics ingestion, and validates that security events are properly captured and analyzed. This component ensures that simulation environments generate realistic security telemetry for testing detection capabilities and validating security operations procedures.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As a **Security Operations Center**, I need comprehensive logging and monitoring of all simulation activities for attack detection validation
- As a **Threat Hunter**, I need realistic security telemetry data to test hunting queries and detection logic
- As a **Security Analyst**, I need validation that security events are properly captured and correlated in Sentinel
- As a **Validator Agent**, I need confirmation that telemetry collection is working correctly before declaring environments ready
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need audit trails of all security events and monitoring configurations
- As a **Red Team Member**, I need verification that attack activities generate expected security alerts and telemetry
- As a **SIEM Engineer**, I need automated deployment of detection rules and analytics configurations
- As a **Incident Responder**, I need realistic incident scenarios with complete telemetry chains for training
