# AKS Autoscaler Manager Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The AKS Autoscaler Manager component provides intelligent autoscaling management for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters that host SimBuilder components and simulation workloads. It optimizes resource utilization, manages cost efficiency, handles dynamic scaling based on simulation demands, and ensures performance requirements are met during peak and off-peak usage periods. This component is essential for maintaining cost-effective and responsive Kubernetes infrastructure for simulation environments.
