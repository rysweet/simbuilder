# FinOps Alerting Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The FinOps Alerting component provides comprehensive cost monitoring, budget enforcement, and financial governance for SimBuilder simulation environments. It tracks real-time Azure spending, enforces budget limits, generates predictive cost alerts, and provides optimization recommendations to ensure cost-effective simulation operations. This component serves as the financial control plane for all simulation environments with automated enforcement and detailed cost analytics.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As a **Cost Manager**, I need real-time monitoring of simulation costs with alerts when spending approaches budget limits
- As a **Finance Team**, I need detailed cost breakdowns by simulation, resource type, and organizational unit for accurate billing
- As an **Operations Team**, I need automated budget enforcement that can pause or terminate expensive simulations before overspend
- As a **Project Manager**, I need cost projections and burn rate analysis to plan simulation timelines and resource allocation
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need audit trails of all cost-related decisions and budget enforcement actions
- As a **Resource Planner**, I need cost optimization recommendations based on actual usage patterns and resource efficiency
- As a **Executive Sponsor**, I need executive dashboards with cost trends, budget variance, and ROI metrics for simulation programs
- As a **Developer**, I need cost feedback during simulation planning to make informed resource allocation decisions
