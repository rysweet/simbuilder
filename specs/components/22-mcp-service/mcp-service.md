# MCP Service Specification

## Purpose / Overview

Provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for SimBuilder, enabling AI assistants and LLM
applications to programmatically create, manage, and query simulation environments. Serves as an
intelligent interface layer that allows conversational AI to interact with SimBuilder capabilities.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As an **AI Assistant**, I need MCP tools to create simulations from natural language requests
- As a **Developer**, I need programmatic access to SimBuilder through AI-powered interfaces
- As a **Security Researcher**, I need conversational interfaces for complex simulation queries
- As an **LLM Application**, I need structured tools for simulation management and reporting

## Dependencies

- **Configuration Service**: For centralized configuration management and environment settings
- **LLM Foundry Integration**: For orchestrating LLM interactions and natural language processing
- Core API Service (primary backend)
- MCP Protocol Implementation
- Authentication and authorization services

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide comprehensive MCP tools for simulation lifecycle
- Support complex queries and reporting through MCP resources
- Maintain security and access control for programmatic access
- Enable natural language to simulation conversion

## Open Questions

- MCP tool design and capability scope?
- Authentication and security model for AI access?
- Rate limiting and usage controls?
