# Microsoft 365 Integration Specification

## Purpose / Overview

The Microsoft 365 Integration component populates simulation environments with realistic Microsoft
365 content including emails, documents, SharePoint sites, Teams channels, and calendar entries. It
creates authentic workplace scenarios that enable comprehensive testing of productivity suite-based
attacks while maintaining data privacy and security isolation. This component supports sophisticated
attack simulations involving phishing, document-based malware, and collaboration platform
exploitation.

## Functional Requirements / User Stories

- As a **DataSeeder Agent**, I need to populate mailboxes with realistic email conversations and
  attachments for phishing simulations
- As a **Security Researcher**, I need SharePoint sites with realistic document libraries and
  permission structures for testing access control vulnerabilities
- As a **Red Team Member**, I need Teams channels with realistic conversations and file sharing to
  simulate collaboration-based attacks
- As a **Attack Analyst**, I need calendar entries and meeting structures to test calendar-based
  social engineering scenarios
- As a **Compliance Officer**, I need synthetic M365 data that mimics real organizational patterns
  without exposing sensitive information
- As a **Planner Agent**, I need to understand M365 service dependencies and configuration
  requirements for simulation planning
- As a **Validator Agent**, I need to verify that M365 content matches attack scenario requirements
  and telemetry expectations
- As a **Operations Team**, I need automated cleanup of M365 content when simulations are
  decommissioned
